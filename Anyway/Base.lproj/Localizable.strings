 *      The format for a key should be as follows:
 *      1. screen name
 *      2. followed by short (1-2 words) description of the string
 *      3. followed by what it is (e.g., "label", "button", "alert_ok" etc.)
 *
 *      All lowercase, seperated with underscores.
 *
 *      e.g.: 
 *            "accidents_list_all_button"
 *            "info_close_button"
